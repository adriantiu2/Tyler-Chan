            <h3>See Their Faces</h3>
            <p>During Coronavirus times, it became a tough challenge to visit my grandparents as frequently as I used to. And having moved abroad for school, I only see them in the Summertimes now. FaceTime is an amazing tool that has always allowed me to keep in close contact with all 4 of my beautiful grandparents. We catch up everyday. Through the ups and downs, at least I can see their faces from a long distance. It was last year when my grandma was living her last moments and I was in class in the Netherlands. I picked up the call and I feel better that she was able to hear my voice one last time to let her know I love her forever. This project is a preservation of memories across my family whom I will always hold closer to my heart more than anything.</p>
